### Interest-Based Advertising
The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve you ads, including interest-based ads, on the Service or on third-party services after you leave the Service, and we may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. “Interest-based ads” are behavioral ads targeted to you based on your activities across third-party sites and across time, including retargeting of ads after you have left the Service and are on a third-party service.
## INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Our Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.
## YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS
### Opt-out of marketing e-mails and other direct marketing
You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications, such as marketing e-mails from us by following the instructions in such communications.
### Opt-out of targeted advertising
You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your iOS or Android device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You can also visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), which provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies. Additionally, some third parties that serve Interest-based ads via mobile apps may offer you choices regarding such practices and their technologies, including offering a device-based opt-out option via a downloadable app available at: http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. We are not responsible for this app, including without limitation its accuracy or limitations, or any representations made in connection with it.

For personalized in-app advertising you will be asked for consent before watching the first ad. If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time using the options provided in the device settings. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
### Access the personal data we hold about you
If you request, we will provide you a copy of your personal data in an electronic format.
### Your other rights
You also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object to how we use or share your data, and restrict how we use or share your data. You can always withdraw your consent, for example by turning off GPS location sharing in your mobile device settings.

You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
## COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyze use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. The technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.

We may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other precise location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location with other users as part of the services we provide via the Service. Upon you downloading the app, we provide location-based technologies to determine your approximate and/or exact location information. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, we or some of our partners and others we work with may utilize low power Bluetooth, wifi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the app can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the app. Because such precise location-based technologies are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Service such as to send you more specific and relevant messages and offers. In addition, you may be able to send your location information via the Service to other Service users. You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to others. Where a user of the Service requests that their location information be revealed to other persons, the user will be provided options for managing sharing services, which may be through third party services such as through social media networks. We are not responsible for the acts, omissions or policies of such third parties.

There may be other technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.

Third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “Do Not Track signals”. However, there is not yet a uniform technological standard. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so when a standard is developed and widely adopted.
## HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA
### Security Safeguards
In order to help ensure a secure and safe user experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.
### Data retention
We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused app accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.

Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who generated content or information on the Service, can request removal of such content or information by contacting us at privacy@rosie.com, detailing where the content or information is generated and attesting that you generated it. Thereafter, we will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the content from public view prospectively or anonymize the content, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. Please note that this removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal (e.g., third parties may have republished or archived the content in a manner that we do not control).
## AGE LIMITS
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.  If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.  No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data.  If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.
